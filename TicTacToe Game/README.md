# üïπÔ∏è Java Tic-Tac-Toe with an Unbeatable AI

Hey there! This is my take on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe, built from scratch in Java. I wanted to create more than just a simple grid, so I packed it with features to make it feel like a complete, polished game that runs right in your console.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Two Ways to Play:** Go head-to-head with a friend in **Player-vs-Player (PvP)** mode, or if you're feeling brave, you can challenge the computer in **Player-vs-AI** mode.
* **A Full Game Experience:** It's got everything you'd expect! There's a main menu, a coin toss to decide who goes first, scorekeeping across multiple rounds, and of course, the option to play again.

## ü§ñ A Quick Word About the AI...

Now, about that computer opponent‚ÄîI gave it a brain! It uses the **Minimax algorithm**, which is a fancy way of saying it thinks ahead. It looks at every possible move you could make and every move it could make in response, always choosing the perfect path to either win or force a draw.

So, just a friendly warning: **it's designed to be unbeatable**. You can try your best, but you'll never win against it. The best you can hope for is a draw!

## üöÄ How to Run the Code

1.  **Clone the repository** or download the `TicTacToe.java` file.
2.  **Compile the Java file** in your terminal:
    ```bash
    javac TicTacToe.java
    ```
3.  **Run the compiled code:**
    ```bash
    java TicTacToe
    ```
4.  The game will start in your console. Follow the on-screen prompts to play!
